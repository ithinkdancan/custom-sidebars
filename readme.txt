Allows to create your own widgetized areas and custom sidebars, and select what sidebars to use for each post or page.

== Description ==

Sometimes it is necessary to show different elements on the sidebars for some posts or pages. The themes nowadays give you some areas to put the widgets, but those areas are common for all the posts that are using the same template. NOTE: **You need to use a theme that accepts widgets to make this plugin work** 

Custom Sidebars allows you to create all the widgetized areas you need, your own custom sidebars, configure them adding widgets, and replace the default ones on the posts or pages you want in just few clicks.

You can set also new default sidebars for all the posts of a custom content type easily, keeping the chance of change them individually.

This way your will boost the content manager facet of your Wordpress installation.
